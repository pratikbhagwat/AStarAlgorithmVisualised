This code does the A star visualization on a topological map.
The map can have 4 seasons and it changes accordingly.
The task is to find the optimal path for a runner to run from point A to point B in a given season.

How To Run the code:
step 1: run the Astar.py with appropriate inputs.( Image of the map,source destination coordinates, season, outputimage )
step 2: run the videoTest.py to generate the video from the images generated in step1.
